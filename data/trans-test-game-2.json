  "game_comment": "Allen Holds off Lamar to win a classic state title game\n\nKyler Murray's 111 yards rushing and 3 total touchdowns helped carry his Allen Eagles to a 21-15 victory over Houston Lamar.\n\nThe Eagles defense did their part as they made it difficult for the Lamar offense to pick up points as they were held to a new season low.  Running backs Darrell Colbert and Ronnie Wesley who although both scored, were held under the season averages.\n\nDespite only throwing for 39 yards, Murray's 100 rush yards and zero turnovers were key figures in the Eagle victory.\n\nThis is the first state championship for Allen in its school history."
