Quarterback Andrew Paredez helped put the game out of reach by throwing two fourth-quarter touchdowns, finishing with 197 yards on 14 of 21 passing.\n\nHillcrest (0-1) wide receiver Jacoby Ogbanna proved to be reliable all night, ending the contest with eight catches for 100 yards. Quarterback Asher Randall threw for 117 yards.\n"
