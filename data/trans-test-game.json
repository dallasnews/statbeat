  "game_comment": " W.T White running back Ben Ebeke rushed for 182 yards and scored two touchdowns, as W.T. White rolled to a win over Hillcrest 30-6\n\nThe W.T.  White (1-0) defense only needed three plays before forcing the first interception of the year. Ebeke scored on a 3-yard run, then later from 1-yard out to give W.T. White a 14-0 halftime advantage. Quarterback Andrew Paredez helped put the game out of reach by throwing two fourth-quarter touchdowns, finishing with 197 yards on 14 of 21 passing.\n\nHillcrest (0-1) wide receiver Jacoby Ogbanna proved to be reliable all night, ending the contest with eight catches for 100 yards. Quarterback Asher Randall threw for 117 yards.\n"
